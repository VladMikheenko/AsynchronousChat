## Overview
The rationale behind this project was to practise asynchronous programming, asyncio in particular, by building an asychronous chat, which can handle multiple clients concurrently. Obviously, client <-> server model was used, where there is only one server, which broadcasts messages, and multiple possible clients, which send ones.

## Installation process
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/VladMikheenko/asynchronous-chat.git

## A little dive
Project as such consists of two parts: **client.py** and **server.py**.
